Messi grabbed his second goal of the night, and his 661st for Barcelona, with another curled, left-footed shot from distance in stoppage time.\r\nThe win takes Barcelona, who have already reached the Copa del Rey final, above Real Madrid and into second with 11 league games of the season remaining.', '161601040618.jpg', 1, 0, '2021-03-17 19:49:50', 1, 'Lionel Messi scored twice and made another on the day he equalled Xavi\'s record for most Barcelona appearances.'),

So which of these are working best? Journalists from across Europe give their views.\r\nLigue 1 - \'It has become inaccessible\'\r\n Mauricio Pochettino has taken charge of Paris St-Germain this season but has yet to experience a proper welcome from fans because of restrictions\r\nIn France, lockdown has coincided with a TV broadcasting rights crisis. Ligue 1 is not a universally popular product - even domestically - and the most recent four-year rights agreement with Mediapro has collapsed after just five months.\r\n&quot;It is impossible to talk about Covid\'s impact without mentioning the television rights crisis - they are linked,&quot; said Paris-based Jonathan Johnson of CBS Sports.\r\n&quot;The loss of spectators is an obvious issue because so many clubs live hand to mouth on matchday income, TV money and transfers. Mediapro has massively exacerbated that.&quot;\r\nConcerns about the television rights contract surfaced soon after the season started. In October, Mediapro chief executive Jaume Roures insisted his company would not walk away, but made clear a desire to renegotiate terms because of the pandemic.\r\n&quot;No-one could have predicted the social and economic effects of Covid-19,&quot; Roures said. &quot;This has led to us seeing with the LFP [French football\'s governing body] how we can adapt to the situation, without calling into question the commitment we made in April 2018.&quot;\r\nIn December, LFP released a statement saying the Mediapro deal had ended,\r\nwith the broadcaster only committed to showing matches until January, and with Canal Plus negotiating to take over the rights.\r\n&quot;French football is being forced to modernise,&quot; Johnson added. &quot;It has never really been about the event of watching a match on TV or in the stadium, more about getting people interested in the product.\r\n&quot;Many turn away from Ligue 1 because they believe it is inferior to other leagues. However, now there is nowhere to watch free-to-air football.
